,IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT WEEK 10 ,,,,,,,,,
,"If you are not feeling well recovered after completing week 9 (achy joints, poor sleep, low energy) take an extra rest day or two before running Week 10.

-        Always use a good spotter when attempting max effort lifts
-        Always use safety bars on squat and bench press (in case you have to dump the bar)
-        Do not test maxes if you are feeling joint pain
-        Do not test maxes if you do not feel properly recovered
-        Do not test maxes if you do not have a good spotter
-        Maxes should be done at a 9.5-10 RPE: It is not necessary to push to the point where you actually fail. I recommend stopping at the point where you don’t think you could get another rep with good form.


What week to run?

-        Run Week 10A only if you have competitive powerlifting goals
-        Run Week 10B if you have mostly bodybuilding and general strength goals
